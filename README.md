# PyBer Analysis

## Overview of Project

### This project was built to test the knowledge on Matplotlibs. We are working for a rideshare company called PyBer. The source uses rides across urban, suburban and rural cities. This analysis is done to provide insight to decision makers at the company.

## Results

### As it can be seen in the data frame, Urban cities had the most rides, drivers, and total fares compared to the other two cities. But, rural cities had the most average fare per ride and average fare per driver. Rural cities may have had the higest average, but they also had the lowest amount of drivers, rides and total fares. Suburban cities were in the middle of the three.

## Summary

### Three business recommendations for the disparities among the cities are: 
* ### Get more drivers in rural cities
* ### Try to reduce the price for a fare so that it is more affordable in rural cities
* ### Have initiatives or bonus opportunities for drivers that work in rural areas for more rides
